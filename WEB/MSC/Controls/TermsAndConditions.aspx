                By signing below or providing an electronic signature over the Internet or the telephone, you authorize  
                <b>CSAA Insurance Group</b> and/or its affiliated companies ("we," "us" and "our") to initiate charges to your credit card or debits to your bank account or debit card identified below automatically (an "automatic payment") (1) to pay your insurance premium and any service charge and (2) for any returned payment fee imposed as described below.  Your authorization also covers any adjustments due to changes in premiums or entries made in error.  Your authorization applies to new and renewal policies.  </h6>
            <h6 class="style11">
                <b>Billing Amounts</b></br>
                Your premiums may vary, including based on changes in coverage or other information.  The amount of your insurance premium and any returned payment fee will be included on a billing statement sent to you at least 10 days before the date on which the premium and any returned payment fee will be charged or debited.

       <h6 class="style11">
                <b>Sufficient Available Funds</b></br>
                You agree to continue to make payments by check or money order until we have notified you that your automatic payment authorization has been activated. You should ensure that sufficient collected funds are in your account or sufficient credit is available on your credit card to satisfy each payment and that your account or card has not been closed or expired. You agree to notify us of any change in your account or card, including a change in account number or expiration date. If a payment is returned unpaid, we will impose a returned payment fee, and we may resubmit the payment up to the number of times permitted by applicable law. Your bank or card issuer may also impose fees for returned payments. If a payment remains unpaid for any reason, you will be obligated to make the
                payment by check or money order, and we may cancel your automatic payment authorization immediately upon notice to you. Failure to pay your premium may also result in our canceling your insurance policy in accordance with applicable law.
